# travell_recomendation

Study project to implement UI feature.

## Few Words

This project is inspired by design I found on Dribble [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/14288814-Travel-Recommendation-App-Concept/attachments/5942785?mode=media).

I used [JSON Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) for mockup backend. It's easy to setup and does'nt require JavaScript knowlege. Just need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), It will install npm automatically.

 How to setup mockup server is explained in a package [JSON Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server).
